# 1) Vertical Slider

This is an image slider that slides vertically after clicking the direction buttons. For each image, there is a  small caption inserted.

This app filters users based on name and location. To fetch the users, I used [randonmuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) API to fetch dummy users contained as raw JSON format.
